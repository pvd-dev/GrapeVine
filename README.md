##Grapevine
Grapevine helps to make giving feedback easier. Users can generate QR codes that they can add to workshops, powerpoints, put in waiting areas or share after events to collect feedback on how visitors liked the event. 

## Installation
To run a developmentserver run: 
- python Developmentserver.py

For production server: 
- gunicorn.sh (for local running)
- deployscript.py to deploy to Lightsail and start the server there (This probably only works for me as you need very specific keys to deploy to amazon)
