## Frankly
Frankly helps to make giving feedback easier. There are 4 methods that frankly can help you get feedback: 
1. Through SMS: Frankly sends you the template to your phone, and you can copy it to any messaging app you like
2. Link: Simply share a URL 
3. QR codes: Simply print QR codes to your own design and share it in the real world
4. Email: Simply email yourself the template or send it in a batch to your customers directly 

## Installation:



#### Technology: 
The Frankly app is a Flask app wrapped in a docker image. The docker image is ran from AWS Lightsail container service. Most of the functionality has been hand built from scratch, except for SQLAlchemy for the Database, and a Twillio API for sending text messages. Most of the frontend is Bootstrap5 and chartJS for the graphs. 

#### Set up: 
- You'll need a configfile named `Env_Settings.cfg` that takes configuration keys like (Secret key, sql details, twillio API key, number of free responses , SMTP credentials, and a list of local stopwords). 
- Upon startup the server will load in these keys so it can function 
- You'll need an SQL server to store records. Connection details are also added to the env_settings file, however SQLite can be used as well

#### how to run:
To run a developmentserver run: 
- `python3 Developmentserver.py` this will start the built in Flask development server. This is not recommended for production use

For production server: 
- `gunicorn.sh` (for local running)
Or to deploy to AWS:
- `python3 deployscript.py` to deploy to Lightsail and start the server there (This probably only works for me as you need very specific keys to deploy to amazon)
